           <p class="fs-5 fw-bold" style="font-family: Saudagar;"> Who was Steve Jobs?</p>
           <p class="container-fluid">Steve Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc., and a key figure in the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Jobs also co-founded Pixar Animation Studios, which later merged with The Walt Disney Company. He was known for his visionary approach to technology and design, leading to the creation of iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.</p>

        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold" style="font-family: Saudagar;"> Early Life and Education</p>
        <p>Jobs lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California, within the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley. He was curious from childhood, sometimes to his detriment. According to the BBC’s Science Focus magazine, Jobs was taken to the emergency room twice as a toddler—once after sticking a pin into an electrical socket and burning his hand, and another time because he had ingested poison. His mother Clara had taught him to read by the time he started kindergarten. As a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul showed his son how to take apart and reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity, and mechanical prowess in young Jobs. </p>
        <p>Although Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school—a proposal that his parents declined.</p>
        <p>While attending Homestead High School, Jobs joined the Explorer’s Club at Hewlett-Packard. It was there that he saw a computer for the first time. He even picked up a summer job with HP after calling company cofounder Bill Hewlett to ask for parts for a frequency counter he was building. It was at HP that a teenaged Jobs met he met his future partner and cofounder of Apple Computer Steve Wozniak, who was attending the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>After high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking direction, he withdrew from college after six months and spent the next year and a half dropping in on creative classes at the school. Jobs later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed his love of typography. In 1974, Jobs took a position as a video game designer with Atari. Several months later, he left the company to find spiritual enlightenment in India, traveling further and experimenting with psychedelic drugs.</p>

            <p>In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. in Jobs' family garage. The duo aimed to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices. Their first product, the Apple I, was a single-board computer kit that was hand-built by Wozniak and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips)—a base kit concept which was a significant advancement over the other hobbyist computers of the time.</p>
            <p>Following the success of the Apple I, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II in 1977. The Apple II was one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Wozniak. It featured a color display, an open architecture, and the first-ever spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, which made the Apple II a vital tool for business users. The success of the Apple II allowed Apple to become a major player in the burgeoning personal computer market.</p>
            <p>Apple continued to innovate with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, which was the first personal computer to feature a graphical user interface (GUI) controlled by a mouse. The Macintosh set the standard for user-friendly computing and solidified Apple's reputation as a leader in the technology industry. Despite facing numerous challenges and competition, Jobs' vision and relentless pursuit of innovation helped establish Apple as one of the most influential technology companies in the world.</p>

            <p>Steve Jobs married Laurene Powell on March 18, 1991. The couple met while Laurene was a student at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and they were introduced by a mutual friend. They had three children together: Reed, Erin, and Eve. Jobs also had a daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, from a previous relationship with Chrisann Brennan.</p>
            <p>Despite his demanding career, Jobs was known to be a devoted family man. He often spoke about how his family was a source of strength and inspiration for him. Laurene Powell Jobs has continued to be a prominent figure in philanthropy and business, carrying on the legacy of her late husband.</p>
            <p>Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa was complex and evolved over time. Initially, he denied paternity, but later, they reconciled, and she became a part of his family. Lisa Brennan-Jobs has written about her experiences growing up with her father in her memoir, "Small Fry."</p>

            <p>In October 2003, Steve Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer known as a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Despite his initial reluctance to undergo conventional medical treatment, Jobs eventually had surgery to remove the tumor in July 2004. Over the following years, he faced several health challenges and took multiple medical leaves of absence from Apple.</p>
            <p>Jobs' health continued to decline, and on August 24, 2011, he resigned as CEO of Apple, recommending Tim Cook as his successor. He remained involved with the company as Chairman of the Board until his death. Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, surrounded by his family at his home in Palo Alto, California.</p>
            <p>According to his sister, Mona Simpson, Jobs' last words were, "Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow." These words have been interpreted in various ways, but they remain a poignant reminder of his profound impact on the world and the legacy he left behind. Jobs' death was met with an outpouring of grief and tributes from around the globe, highlighting the indelible mark he made on technology, design, and innovation.</p>
